# Mortgages are boring

This is not a secret. Especially when it's about "RE" mortgaging - a process where you renew your mortgage package for a better deal. Dynamo is here to make the whole process easy and enable users to apply in a pace that they'd like to -which is usually had to be done in one go.

# User Inputs

Through the interviews, there was one major output. It was obvious that 'remortgaging' was a hassle for people and no one liked it. It was a great challenge (and an opportunity) to move forward on such a disliked process. The first step was to eliminate the Grinch within the product. The branding was playing a great factor in this process. Intentionally it was created jolly and lovable.

# Making it appealing

But the content wasn't fun. The major issue was the nature of remortgaging process. It's heavily relied on collecting as much as personal data as it could be. It was either done in one session -mostly a whole day- or done in several small sessions distributed over a month. We could basically generate a data form collecting this information and directly serve to the mortgage brokers.
