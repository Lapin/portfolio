# All started with a coffee

DTT is a meetup series where we aimed to bring startups, professionals and students together and share their failures/successes with each other. The first meet up was just for fun and beers but received very positive feedback and nearly all the attendees asked to make another one. We immediately sat down and planned a couple of meet-ups and we've noticed that there were lots of questions flying about how methodologies could be applied to the problems.

Noticing such need (and having so many people together who are interested in design thinking methodologies, we decided to include a few mockup workshop ideas where people can exercise solving the mock problems. Of course, it wasn't like a contest or anything. We were just enabling a platform where people can exercise with other minds.

After a few more meets, our friend  got in touch with openIDEO and told us that we can transform all of this interest into a meaningful and beneficial output for everyone. Following that we've successfully formed the openIDEO's Istanbul chapter.
